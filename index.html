      <p class="header-body">
        I only ever wanted to make MySpace layouts and cute Neopets pages but
        now I've gotta be a <em>UX Engineer</em> and
        <em>Designer Who Codes</em> to pay the bills. I've been known to work
        across disciplines to bring digital designs and products to life usually
        by way of <em>design systems</em> and filling in the gaps between design
        and engineering. Sometimes I freelance, and sometimes I make
        <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ohaiclaystina/">ceramics</a></i
        >, but most often you can find me just going about my business in the
        great state of Maine.
