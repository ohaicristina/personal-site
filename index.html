        I only ever wanted to make MySpace layouts and cute Neopets pages but
        now I've gotta be a <em>UX Engineer</em> and
        <em>Designer Who Codes</em> to pay the bills. I've been known to work
        across disciplines to bring digital designs and products to life usually
        by way of <em>design systems</em> and filling in the gaps between design
        and engineering. Sometimes I freelance, and sometimes I make
        <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ohaiclaystina/">ceramics</a></i
        >, but most often you can find me just going about my business in the
        great state of Maine.

              I work on the front-of-the-front-end helping people notarize their
              documents. I act as the lead developer for our design system
              components to make sure that they not only match up with what our
              design team has created, but also ensure that they’re accessible
              and easy for our engineering team to use.
